# MPF_ANALYSIS

## Problem statement
Hong Kong’s Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) has recorded its second-largest annual loss 
since 2008, despite performing well in the subsequent years. There are various views as 
to what has cause a dip in the performance of the Hong Kong MPF fund.

Our aim is to use Descriptive Data Analysis to investigate the performance of various
MPF schemes by inspecting the movement and spread of the annualized percentage return. 
The data will be inspected over 5-year period to identify patterns and develop
insights as to why the annualized return is negative.
